# Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) - Python Script
This repository contains a Python script that applies Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) to a given signal. AWGN is a type of random noise that follows a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a specified variance.

## How to Use
Clone the repository or download the awgn.py file.

Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x is recommended).

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the awgn.py file is located.

Run the script using the following command:

 1. Open Folder
```shell

cd ./AdditiveWhiteGaussianNoice
```


 1. Execute
```shell

python awgw.ipynb
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the necessary parameters such as signal amplitude, noise power, and signal duration.

The script will generate a noisy signal by adding AWGN to the original signal and display the results.

## Why Create a Script for AWGN?
There are several reasons why creating a script for applying Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) can be useful:

1. **Simulating Real-World Conditions**: In various fields such as telecommunications, audio processing, and image processing, it is often necessary to evaluate the performance of algorithms under realistic conditions. Adding AWGN to signals allows you to simulate the effects of noise that commonly exist in practical scenarios.

2. **Testing Signal Processing Algorithms**: AWGN is a widely used benchmark for testing and evaluating the performance of various signal processing algorithms such as denoising, filtering, compression, and estimation techniques. Having a readily available script simplifies the process of generating noisy signals for testing these algorithms.

3. **Educational Purposes**: Understanding the impact of noise on signals is fundamental in many scientific and engineering disciplines. By providing a script that demonstrates the process of adding AWGN, students and researchers can learn and experiment with noise effects in a hands-on manner.

4. **Prototyping and Development**: When developing signal processing applications, it is often beneficial to quickly prototype and visualize the effects of noise on signals. With a ready-to-use script, you can easily integrate the AWGN functionality into your applications and analyze the results.

By providing a Python script for applying AWGN, this repository aims to facilitate the use of AWGN in various contexts, enabling users to experiment, learn, and evaluate the effects of noise on signals.
